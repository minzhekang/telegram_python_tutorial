# Python telegram tutorial

The purpose of this code is to bring light on how the `telegram-python-bot` package works.

Codes for both methods of using the package and using the `requests` package shown in the source code. 
Comparison should be done between the two, to understand the package better.

Additional source code of using the `Handlers` methods are also included along with a threaded version of it.
